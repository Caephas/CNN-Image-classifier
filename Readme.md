# Image Classification Project

This project is about classifying images into two categories: Happy or Sad. The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Install the necessary packages by running:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib
```

## Usage

The main script is `Image classification.ipynb`. You can run it in a Jupyter notebook.

The script performs the following steps:

1. Imports necessary libraries.
2. Loads and preprocesses the image data.
3. Builds and trains a CNN model on the training data.
4. Evaluates the model's performance on the test data.
5. Tests the model on a new image.
6. Saves the trained model.
